# SecNoteSploit Exploit APK 

This is the source code to exploiting the [Secure Notes Android App](https://www.mobilehackinglab.com/course/lab-secure-notes) by [MobileHackingLab](https://www.mobilehackinglab.com/).

## About the Vulnerable App ðŸ“±

The SecureNotes app manages access to the user notes. You set a 4-digit PIN that the user has to enter to access the notes.

The app exposes a Content Provider which makes it possible for external apps to query it.

## About this Project app ðŸ’£

This exploit app queries the provider, and performs a brute force of the 4-digit PIN to retrieve the clear-text secret.
